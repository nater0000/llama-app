# simple-app

This is currently based on a MSVC sample app, so the file layout is very flat and not conducive to multiple platforms or environments. Hopefully this will change soon.

### TODO
- Add gcc implementation
- Refactor Windows Resource into platform-specific feature
- Refactor .sln,.vcproj into ./scripts/
- Refactor ./src/html/* into ./html/*
- Add cmake for basic project compilation
- Add Windows Resource feature usage into gcc implementation
? Add gradle
